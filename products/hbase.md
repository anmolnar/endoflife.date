> [Apache HBase](https://hbase.apache.org/) Apache HBaseâ„¢ is the Hadoop database. Use it when you need random, realtime read/write access to your Big Data. This project's goal is the hosting of very large tables -- billions of rows X millions of columns -- atop clusters of commodity hardware.

No releases are scheduled in advance.
